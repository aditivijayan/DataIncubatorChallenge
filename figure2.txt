This Figure shows the rating pattern of two users. It should be noted that the total 
number ratings from the two users are different. The plot on the right shows the rating
pattern of the most active user (User1) and the one on the left shows the rating pattern for 
another user (User2).

It can be seen by comparing the two plots that User2 is more likely to a lower rating 
to an item than User1. Nearly 90% of the ratings given by User1 are either four- or -five 
stars and three-star rating to negligibly small number of items. User2 relied on the three-star
rating for nearly a third of the items.
